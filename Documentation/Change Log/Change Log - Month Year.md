## When to Create Monthly Splits

Create a new monthly change log when:
- The current month reaches 20+ entries
- You need better organization of daily/weekly changes
- The file becomes difficult to navigate

**Naming Convention**: Always use "Change Log - [Full Month Name] [Year].md"
Examples:
- "Change Log - January 2025.md"
