# Completed Bugs

This file tracks all bugs that have been fixed and resolved. When a bug is fixed, it should be moved from `Bugs/Bugs.md` to this file with full resolution details.

When this file reaches 50 entries, create a new file named `Completed Bugs - 1-50.md` and start a fresh `Completed Bugs.md` for new entries.
