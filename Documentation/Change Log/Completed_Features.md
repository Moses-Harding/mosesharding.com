# Completed Features

This file tracks all small features that have been completed. Features are moved here from `Roadmaps/Roadmap-Small Features.md` when completed.

**Note**: Small features (FEAT-###) do NOT get entries in the main Change Log.md - they are tracked here only.

When this file reaches 50 entries, create a new file named `Completed Features - 1-50.md` and start a fresh `Completed_Features.md` for new entries.

## Splitting Guidelines

When this file reaches 50 completed features:

2. Create a new empty `Completed_Features.md` for entries 51+
3. Update any references in documentation to point to the appropriate file
