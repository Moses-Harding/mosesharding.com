# Completed Improvements

This file tracks all improvements to existing features that have been completed. Improvements are moved here from `Roadmaps/Roadmap-Improvements.md` when completed.

**Note**: Improvements (IMP-###) do NOT get entries in the main Change Log.md - they are tracked here only.

When this file reaches 50 entries, create a new file named `Completed Improvements - 1-50.md` and start a fresh `Completed_Improvements.md` for new entries.
