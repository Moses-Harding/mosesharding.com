## Alternative: Progressive Web App (PWA)
Consider implementing PWA instead of native app:
- Pros: Single codebase, no app store fees, instant updates
- Cons: Limited native features, discovery challenges

## Notes
- Web portfolio typically doesn't need app store submission
- Focus on excellent web experience first
- Consider app only if specific mobile requirements exist
