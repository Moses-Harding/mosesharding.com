# Deferred

Features, tasks, or bugs that are unlikely to be implemented but might be considered in the future.

## Deferred Features

### High-Effort, Low-Value
1. **Multi-language Support**

   - Reason deferred: Effort outweighs benefit for personal portfolio
   - Consider for: V2.0 if targeting international clients

2. **Backend CMS**

   - Consider for: V3.0 if content becomes very dynamic

3. **Real-time Chat**
   - Description: Live chat integration for visitor contact
   - Reason deferred: Privacy concerns, maintenance overhead
   - Alternative: Simple contact form or email

   - Reason deferred: Complex, may slow loading
   - Alternative: High-quality images/videos

## Deferred Bugs

### Minor Visual Issues

   - Fix if: Major redesign occurs

## Technical Debt
1. **Code Refactoring for Framework X**
   - Description: Rewrite using React/Vue/Svelte
   - Reason deferred: Current vanilla JS is working well
   - Consider for: When features become too complex

## Alternative Solutions Implemented
Instead of deferred items, these simpler solutions were chosen:
- Static config.js instead of CMS
- Email contact instead of form
- Responsive design instead of separate mobile app
- CSS animations instead of JavaScript libraries

## Review Process
Review deferred items annually to determine if:
- Technology has matured
- Business needs have changed
- Implementation has become easier
- Value proposition has increased

## Moving Items Out of Deferred
To move an item to active development:
1. Re-evaluate effort vs value
2. Consider current priorities
3. Update to appropriate roadmap
4. Document reasoning for activation
