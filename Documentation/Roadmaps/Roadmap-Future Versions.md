3. Provide clear reason for deferral
4. Write comprehensive description
5. List detailed implementation considerations
6. Consider dependencies between features

## Notes

- Future versions are for features that require significant architectural changes or new technologies
- Items should be moved to active roadmaps when development on that version begins
- Consider the cumulative impact of all features in a version
- Each version should represent a significant milestone in the platform's evolution
- Technical debt and refactoring should be considered for each version boundary
